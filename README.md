# Capture the Flag (CTF) Guide for UF Students
## A quick and dirty (unofficial) guide to getting started in participating in CTFs with UF's Kernel Sanders team

_Disclaimer: The author apologizes in advance for any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, but he, possibly like the reader, is a relative newcomer to the world of CTFs._

If you are reading this, it may be because you:

* Need to meet the CTF participation requirements for a class such as CIS 4204 (Penetration Testing: Ethical Hacking).
* Desire to earn leeway (i.e., sorta extra) credit towards your Final Exam for CIS 4204 or CIS 4930 (Malware Reverse Engineering).
* Keep hearing how cool and fun CTFs are and just want to see what the fuss is all about.

This short guide is written to help you jumpstart your foray into participating in CTFs with Kernel Sanders.  It is not intended to teach you how CTFs actually work or how to succeed at them (as I, a beginner myself, definitely am unqualified to do this).

Here are some preliminary thoughts to keep in mind:

* This (unofficial) guide is intended for those who wish to participate with the University of Florida's (UF's) Kernel Sanders team.
* Kernel Sanders is the nickname given to the University of Florida Student Infosec Team (UFSIT).  See https://ufsit.club/#/
* Participating with Kernel Sanders may be a requirement of your course instructor for credit. In other words, you can't go it alone.
* Kernel Sanders typically will particpate in a CTF nearly every weekend of the year.
* Most CTFs start on a Friday and end on a Saturday or Sunday.  There are exceptions, of course.
* Kernel Sanders may even sometimes participate in two or more CTFs simultaneously in any given weekend.
* To see what the pool of possible CTFs for an upcoming weekend are, just head over to https://ctftime.org/.
* It is very common to hear from beginners how hard it is to solve CTF challenges.  There is only one way to get better at these, and it's to invest the time.

Here is how to get started:

* Join the UFSIT_CTF_SQUAD Discord server.  Discord is a messaging, collaboration, and community platform, somewhat like but also quite different from Slack, Teams, etc.  A link to join UFSIT_ctf_squad is:  https://discord.gg/h2qEXqc48p.  Do pay attention at the ensuing Web page and only type in a username if you do NOT already have an account; otherwise, click the link a little lower as indicated if you already have an account.  Please note that this link has a limited lifespan.  If it no longer works, reach out to someone who can provide you with a fresh one, e.g., the UFSIT Competition and Development Chair or someone in your class who might be in the know.
* Send an instant message to the Kernel Sanders lead administrator asking to be added to the "CTF TEAM" category and explain why (e.g., "I am a Malware Reverse Engineering student who would like to get 50 solves so that I may skip my final exam").  At the time this page was published, the administrator's handle on Discord is @noopnoop (who also happens to be the UFSIT Competition and Development Chair).  You do not want to wait until the day a CTF starts to make the request.
* Beginning on the Wednesday before the weekend you desire to particpate, periodically check on the #general channel on the Discord "CTF Team" category (once approved) to see in what CTF competitions Kernel Sanders will be participating.  Sometimes, a decision may not be made until the day of.
* Once the decision is made, Kernel Sanders will post or pin its login credentials for the CTF, comprising of a username (or e-mail address) and password.  If it's a post, it will be in the #general channel.  If it's a pinned message, look for the thumbtack (likely red in color) in the upper right corner.
* _At my signal, unleash hell!_

Here are a few suggestions and nuggets of knowledge complete beginners might find helpful:

* Because CTFs are an international affair, it is common to see start and end times represented in UTC (Universal Time).  To convert from UTC to Eastern Time:
    * If it's presently Eastern Standard Time, subtract five (5) hours, e.g., 22:00 UTC = 17:00 EST (using military time).
    * If it's presently Eastern Daylight Savings Time, subtract four (4) hours, e.g., 22:00 UTC = 18:00 EDT (using military time).
* After signing in to a CTF, you likely will see something resembling a Jeopardy-style scoreboard.  This board will have various challenges falling under certain categories, including but not limited to:
    * Crypto:  Some type of cryptography is involved.
    * Reverse Engineering:  Self-explanatory.
    * Pwn:  I'm not familiar with these, but I believe they typically involve binary exploitation.  Apparently, in slang, to pwn something means to "own" it.
    * Web:  Self-explanatory.
    * Forensic:  These seem to vary but may involve a variety of the above and/or something that doesn't fall in any category at all.
* Each of the challenges has a score associated with it.  The higher the score, the more difficult the challenge is.
* Some CTFs are set up so that each time a team solves a challenge, the number of points to be awarded is reduced.
* Once you solve a CTF challenge, you will be presented with a flag, the form for which may vary, but usually looks something like flag{#######}.  Somewhere on the CTF's website, this form will be indicated.  Here are a few actual flags from prior CTFs:
    * flag{squarectf}
    * CYCTF{c@3$@r_c!ph3r}
    * sun{lucky-octal-encoding-is-the-best-encoding-method}
* To gain credit for solving the challenge, you must enter the flag where indicated.  Once it is solved and points are awarded, then this particular challenge comes off the board.  In other words, you can't get credit for solving a challenge that's already been solved.
* It's a good idea to announce in the appropriate Discord channel as soon as you've solved a challenge so that others don't unknowingly continue working on the same one.  It also may serve double-duty as notification for leeway credit purposes.
* If you want to increase the odds of solving a challenge, it's best to sign in right at the opening bell, while the easier challenges are still unsolved.
* Some CTFs will release new challenges periodically throughout the event.
* It is more common than not for two or more Kernel Sanders teammates to collaborate on challenges.  Such chat typically occurs in the specific Discord channel representing the challenge type, e.g., #crypto.  However, be cognizant of the impact this will have on your ability to earn leeway credit in a course offering it.
* It also is common to find two or more individuals working through the night on challenges, chatting with each other on Discord, crashing for a few hours when the sun comes up, and then resuming efforts.
* Some challenges may take 10 minutes to solve.  Alternatively, you may spend 10+ hours on a challenge and never solve it.  The first legitimate one I solved was a Crypto challenge during my seventh CTF and it took me a little less than two hours.  Conversely, I have double-digit hours on other ones that I never could solve.
* You are allowed to use whatever resources you can find to aid you with your efforts; however, read the published rules first at the respective CTF website.
* If you have zero background in specialized areas such as Web or Reverse Engineering, I personally feel that the Crypto category may be the most intuitive one to tackle as a beginner.  Alternatively, you may want to explore Forensics or Miscellaneous.  If you're reading this during a Spring semester, you may be taking Malware Reverse Engineering, which means that you're focusing on reverse engineering and pwn challenges.  As uttered in the movie _Taken_, "good luck."
