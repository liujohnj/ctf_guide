# Capture the Flag (CTF) Guide for UF Students
## A quick and dirty (unofficial) guide to getting started in participating in CTFs with UF's Kernel Sanders team

If you are reading this, it may be because you:

* Need to meet the CTF participation requirements for a class such as CIS 4204 (Penetration Testing: Ethical Hacking).
* Desire to earn leeway (e.g., sorta extra) credit towards your Final Exam for CIS 4204 or CIS 4930 (Malware Reverse Engineering).
* Keep hearing how cool and fun CTFs are and just want to see what the fuss is all about.

This short guide is written to help you jumpstart your foray into participating in CTFs with Kernel Sanders.  It is not intended to teach you how CTFs actually work or how to succeed at them (as I, a beginner myself, definitely am not the right person to do this).

Here are some preliminary thoughts to keep in mind:

* This (unofficial) guide is intended for those who wish to participate with the University of Florida's (UF's) Kernel Sanders team.
* Kernel Sanders is the nickname given to the University of Florida Student Infosec Team (UFSIT).  See https://ufsit.club/#/
* Participating with Kernel Sanders may be a requirement of your course instructor for credit. In other words, you can't go it alone.
* Kernel Sanders typically will particpate in a CTF nearly every weekend of the year.
* Most CTFs start on a Friday and end on a Saturday or Sunday.  There are exceptions, of course.
* Kernel Sanders may even sometimes participate in two or more CTFs simultaneously in any given weekend.
* To see what the pool of possible CTFs for an upcoming weekend are, just head over to https://ctftime.org/.
* It is very common to hear from beginners how hard solving CTF challenges are.  There is only one way to get better at these, and it's to invest the time.

Here is how to get started:

* Join the UFSIT_CTF_SQUAD Discord server (and sign up for a Discord account if appropriate).  Discord is a messaging, collaboration, and community platform, somewhat like but also quite different from Slack, Teams, etc.  A link for this channel is:  https://discord.gg/h2qEXqc48p.  Please note that this link has a limited lifespan.  If it no longer works, reach out to someone who can provide you with a fresh one, e.g., someone at UFSIT.
* Send an instant message to the Kernel Sanders lead administrator asking to be added to the "CTF TEAM" category and explain why (e.g., "I am a Malware Reverse Engineering student who would like to get 50 solves so that I may skip my final exam").  At the time this page was published, the administrator's handle on Discord is @noopnoop (who also happens to be the UFSIT Competition and Development Chair).  You do not want to wait until the day a CTF starts to make the request.
* Beginning on the Wednesday before the weekend you desire to particpate, periodically check on the #general channel on the Discord "CTF Team" category (once approved) to see in what CTF competitions Kernel Sanders will be participating.  Sometimes, a decision may not be made until the day of.
* Once the decision is made, Kernel Sanders will post or pin its login credentials for the CTF, comprising of an e-mail address or username and password.  If it's a post, it will be in the #general channel.  If it's a pinned message, look for the thumbtack (likely red in color) in the upper right corner.
* _At my signal, unleash hell!_
